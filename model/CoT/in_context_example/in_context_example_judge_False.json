    "Q": "Death receptor-mediated apoptosis can be modulated by several antiapoptotic proteins, including the FLICE-inhibitory proteins (FLIPs). The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus protein (KSHV-FLIP) is expressed by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) and protects cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis. Does KSHV-FLIP inhibit caspase activation?",
    "A": "Yes"

    "Q": "Cocaine addiction is thought to result from neural adaptations that counteract the effects of repeated drug administration. One transcription factor involved in these adaptations is DeltaFosB, which upregulates the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Overexpression of DeltaFosB or chronic cocaine administration increases Cdk5 levels in the striatum. To investigate the role of Cdk5 in cocaine addiction, researchers injected Cdk5 inhibitors into the striatum and assessed the behavioral effects of repeated cocaine administration. Will injection of Cdk5 inhibitors into the striatum reduce the behavioral effects of repeated cocaine administration?",
    "A": "No"
